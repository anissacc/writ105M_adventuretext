This is a project for the UCSB WRIT 105M - Multimedia Writing class. This was created for the Spring 2024 quarter of WRIT 105M, taught by Dr. Frank.
The project is meant to represent the day in a life of a non-binary person, someone who doesn't quite fit in with the other people.
I decided to represent this by having the protag be a slime person, someone who is clearly different but is still a person at the end of the day.
I hope you enjoy.
